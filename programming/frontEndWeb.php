                       Front-end web development is absolutely ubiquitous in the computer industry.  There is no more basic skill that a DevOps professional should have.  However, DevOps professionals do not need to master <i>web design</i> (an entirely different field which requires artistic creativity).  A clear understanding of how <i>web development</i> works is adequate (knowledge of how to implement a web design).  This section will concentrate on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

                          One-page websites are all over the web currently.  Here's an excellent tutorial on how to create one.
                          I'd like to offer thanks to Brad Traversy at Traversy Media, his videos are absolutely wonderful.  I even used this tutorial to create my personal portfolio website (scroll down to see the effect):

                              On the subject of Front-End Web Development, one of the most informative YouTube channel's currently is DevTips, hosted by Travis Nielson, who is an employee of Google and formerly of Tubular Labs.  Travis describes himself as a designer who is also a developer, almost a 50/50 mix.  He has a rare gift and passion for passing on his knowledge - his work is stellar.  Here's a link to his YouTub channel:

                              Another great resource that I've used extensively is the W3Schools.com website.  They have tutorials on several web development technologies, the front-end ones I've used quite a lot both as learning tools and reference guides include:
