                        One of the most powerful tools I've yet discovered for learning about how System Administrators do their job.  This website has a whole curriculum and weeks of learning for any new SysAdmin (or any new DevOps professional!).

                        This is a series of articles I wrote as I watched Computer Science 377 - Operating Systems Introduction (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLacuG5pysFbDQU8kKxbUh4K5c1iL5_k7k" target="_blank">YouTube Playlist</a>) from the University of Massachusetts.  The lecturer is Sean Barker, and this is a phenomenal series about the lower level workings of an operating system.
