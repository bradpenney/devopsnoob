                        Understanding how computers communicate with each other is such a critical skill for any IT professional.  For DevOps professionals it is just as important.  A thorough practical knowledge of the underlying fundamentals is what opens up the possibilities for effective security strategies, efficient data transfer, and many more.  Here are some of the resources I use and find to be excellent:

                          Dell switches, although less used than Cisco switches, are still often encountered in the IT industry.  Here are a few examples of Dell switch commands (CLI) in case you encounter and need some help getting started.

                          The OSI Model is incredibly important in networking.  This extra-brief intro (which will likely grow over time!) will introduce the concept.

                          One of the key parts of building a well-designed enterprise network is to use variable-length subnet masks. The site linked below is very useful, as it doesn't have a lot of extra bells and whistles, it just calculates the masks based on the sizes you want (and your original IP + CIDR).  Its my go to tool for VLSM.

                        <p>
                            Another useful subnet calculator was recommended by my professor when I took an Introduction to Networking course.  It too has its advantages, but as far as I know it does not calculate variable-length subnets.  Still a useful tool, especially when starting to learn the concepts of subnet masking.
