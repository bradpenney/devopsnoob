                      Security is a critical field in IT.  Enterprise networks house very valuable and sensitive information, and protecting that information from black hats is crucial.  A DevOps professional understands the importance of security and is able to implement it in basic ways throughout programs as well as systems.

                              Ransomware is a real problem with today's internet.  Thosands of computers have fallen victim to Ransomware, which is when a outside program takes over the user's computer, encrypts the files and makes the computer unusable until the user contacts the software company (whose contact info is prominently displayed) and pays a fee to have their computer unlocked. One of the newest pieces of Ransomware on the internet as of December 2016 is Kangaroo Ransomware.
