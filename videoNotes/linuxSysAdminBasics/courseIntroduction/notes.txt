Linux Video Course Introduction
Linux is a very useful operating system to learn.  You can do all kinds of things like set up a mail server, run a website, run a torrent server, learn security, all sorts of things from Linux.

The commitment is to follow along with each of the videos, actually doing the commands as they are taught, and even playing around with the systems after the video is done.  This course is taught using Virtual Machines (VMs), so there is little risk of actually damaging the computer which you are learning on.  Its a lot safer than it used to be before VMs were so common!
