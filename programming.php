                      Programming is, obviously, what makes these shiny boxes we call computers useful in modern society.  Computer programming is a skill that nearly everyone should pursue - its useful in nearly any career which interacts with a computer (which is nearly 100% today!).  A DevOps professional should have a solid grasp of several programming languages, and should be familar with data structures, common algorithms, and virtually all aspects of programming.  This section will concentrate on learning languages and algorithms.  As I find useful resources, I'll post them here.  Check back soon!
