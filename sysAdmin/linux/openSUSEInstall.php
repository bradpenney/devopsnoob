                        <p>
                            Traditionally, the use of Linux was limited largely by users being a little worried about installing it on their computers.  Having a Linux-only machine was worrisome, and though dual-booting was possible, it was often cumbersome.  In recent years, however, the ease of use and convenience of virtual machines has made having a Linux computer available for use an easy task.  This brief tutorial will walk through the steps required to set up an openSUSE virtual machine.

                            The software required to follow this process will be:

                            <div>

                                    Using the following link, <a class="inTextLink" href="https://software.opensuse.org/132/en" target="_blank">openSUSE 13.2</a>, download the .iso file and place it wherever you're planning to place the virtual machine (VM).  In my case, I setup a directory in which to house the VM called <em>openSUSE</em>, simply to make maintenance of the VM easier.  openSUSE 13.2 is <strong>4.5GB</strong> so plan accordingly - ensure you've got enough time, bandwidth and data availablity to complete this download.  It can take a while!
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    If you don't have VMWare Workstation Pro 12, you can download it here: <a class="inTextLink" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/workstation-evaluation.html" target="_blank">VMWare Workstation Pro 12.5 (Free Trial Available)</a>.  Once you've downloaded and installed it, you can open it and be presented with a screen like this:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Click on "Create a New Virtual Machine":
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/openSUSEInstall/createNewVM.png">

                                <p>
                                    Ensure "Typical" is selected and click "Next".  Then click "Installer disc image file" and browse to wherever you saved the .iso file we downloaded in Step 1.  Again, I strongly recommend that you create a directory somewhere within your computer's file system that will house the .iso and the VM you are creating.  See this step below:
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/openSUSEInstall/discImage.png">

                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    After clicking "Next", you'll be given the option of naming your new VM.  I chose the name "openSUSE 13.2", but feel free.  Remember, this will show up as the name of the machine, so naming it something fairly intuitive is better than "Goldfish".  But its up to you!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Vastly more important on this screen is <strong>Location</strong> - be sure to browse and place your VM wherever you'd like - the default location is fine if you are only going to use this VM on this local computer, but in my case, I'm placing it on an external drive so the VM is portable.  If VMWare Workstation 12 is installed on a different computer (say, at work or at a friend's house), you can simply take your external storage to the other computer and your VM will work.
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/openSUSEInstall/location.png">
                                    <figcaption>Specify Name and Location for your VM</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    After clicking "Next" you'll be asked to specify the disk size of the virtual machine.  openSUSE recommends 20GB, but in this case I'm going to make it 50GB, just be be sure I have enough room. An important point here is that this is "MAXIMUM" size of the hard drive, so this VM will start out much smaller and will only reach its maximum size of 50GB if it is holding enough files to warrant the space usage.  In these days of relatively cheap disk storage, 50GB is only a small chunk of most hard drives.
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/openSUSEInstall/discCapacity.png">

                                <p>
                                    Another "Next" results in a "Ready to Create Virtual Machine" dialogue, but before we do that we'll click on "Customize Hardware" and increase the amount of RAM this VM will have access to.  Keep in mind here that although openSUSE only needs 768MB of RAM to run, increasing it is a good idea of your computer has RAM to spare (as is the case with many computers today).
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>
                                    Depending on your computer's capability, increase the VM's RAM up to 4GB.
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>
                                    Again depending on your computer's capacity, increasing the number of processors and cores used by your openSUSE VM will increase its performace.
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                    Once these modifications are done, click "Close" and "Finish" and you should be presented with a finished screen looking like this:
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                            <h4><strong>Step 3: Install openSUSE 13.2 on VM</strong></h4>

                                    The next step is to install openSUSE 13.2 on your new VM.   Clicking on the green arrow will begin the process.  The machine should "boot up" within the VMWare window provided.  Clicking inside the window converts your mouse to the mouse of the VM.   After a brief "Welcome" screen, you'll be see the following:
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                    From the list above, using the keyboard, select "Installation" - after which several console screens will fly by, followed by several graphical pages and stop at the following, where you choose your keyboard layout, languages and licenses:
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                    More graphical screens will fly by, with the next stop being Installation Options.  At this point, I'm choosing not to install updates, they'll be installed later.  Choosing now is a fine option, but it does slow down the installation (sometimes dramatically).
                                </p>

                                    In the interest of simplicity, we will accept openSUSE's default partitioning of the hard drive.  Keep in mind that as this is all occuring inside a VM, the modfications being done are only done <strong>inside</strong> the VM, <strong>not to your local machine</strong>.  If everything in th is whole proess goes wrong, you can simply delete the VM and start again.
                                </p>

                                    openSUSE supports multiple graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  Gnome and KDE are very popular - for this installation I'll use KDE, but I will come back and install Gnome later and illustrate switching between the two.
                                </p>

                                    The next dialogue asks you to create new user.  You can choose whatever user name you want; be sure to write this stuff down (or memorize it) so that you don't forget it!  Also, be sure <em>not</em> to use the same password for the system administrator,  this is a bit of a security issue.  Remember 2 passwords!
                                </p>

                                    Because I didn't allow the administrator password to be the same as the user password, I must assign it separately.  No big deal - remember both passwords!

                                    So far we've created a VM with openSUSE 13.2, using a KDE desktop.  Any Linux user will be able to tell you about KDE and GNOME, and which is their favourite.  The idea here is to install both and let the end user explore both and decide which they' prefer.  Begin by powering up the VM (click the green arrow in VMWare).

                                    Once your VM has restarted, you can select GNOME as the desktop, then login as per usual:

Its got pretty much all the same features, they're just located in slightly different menus.  The choice between KDE and GNOME (or other) is purely personal preference.  When you're done, click in the upper left corner, click the Power Button, and choose to "Shutdown".

                                    The next command is <kbd>sudo zypper up</kbd>, which will perform updates.

                                    Zypper will probably offer to update a whole bunch of repositories - simply accept its changes:
                                </p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    Fair Warning - THIS IS A LONG PROCESS!  Be sure you have time for this to complete - at least half an hour.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the updates have completed, I'll need to reboot the computer.  I could close the Terminal (by clicking on the "X") and then restart via Lancher as before, or I can restart via BASH. I'll enter <kbd>sudo reboot</kbd>, then enter my root password, and the computer will restart in a similar way as if I had pressed "Restart" in Launcher.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once restarted, I'll verify the updates zypper just installed.  For example, your VM should now have some vm-tools.  Verify this by opening Terminal, and then typing <kbd>sudo zypper info open-vm-tools</kbd>.  It will look like this if it installed correctly:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Feel free to play around with the VM at this point, make sure it still connects to the Internet, that you can create a file, and so on.  Everything should be working properly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The final step in this entire process is to shutdown the VM and once again create a VMWare Snapshot - with all updates included.  Be sure to name it something you'll understand later:
                                </p>
