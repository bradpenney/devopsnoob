                        <p>
                            This is a walk-through of installing a Mint 18.0 Virtual Machine (VM) using VMWare Workstation Pro.  Mint 18.0 is from the Ubuntu family of Linux, and we will be installing it with the Cinnamon desktop environment.

                            The software required to follow this process will be:

                                    Using the following link, <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=217" target="_blank">Mint 18.0 "Sarah"</a>, download the .iso file and place it wherever you're planning to place the virtual machine (VM).  In my case, I setup a directory in which to house the VM called <em>Mint</em>, simply to make maintenance of the VM easier.  Mint is <strong>1.6GB</strong> so plan accordingly - ensure you've got enough time, bandwidth and data availablity to complete this download.  It shouldn't take more than a few minutes if you have a decent Internet connection.

Once you've downloaded and installed it, you can open it and be presented with a screen like this:

                                    Click on "Create a New Virtual Machine":
                                </p>

                                    Ensure "Typical" is selected and click "Next".  Then click "Installer disc image file" and browse to wherever you saved the .iso file we downloaded in Step 1.  Again, I strongly recommend that you create a directory somewhere within your computer's file system that will house the .iso and the VM you are creating.  See this step below:
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>
                                    VMWare 12 doesn't automatically recognize Mint 18.0 as a valid operating system option, so we're going to have to manually tell it a little bit about the operating system.  We'll tell VMWare that we're installing Linux, and the version will be Ubuntu 64-bit.  This isn't exactly accurate, but VMWAre 12 lacks Mint 18 as an option. Since Mint 18 is based on Ubuntu, however, the settings should be safe and allow us to do whatever is necessary.
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/selectOS.png">

                                    Next is a particularly important screen - name your VM and CHOOSE A LOCATION!  The name is only for reference later, but it is critical that you place the location of your VM where you want.  If you will only be working on this computer, then the local drive is fine.  However, if you want to move your VM, choose an appropriate place - for me, that's my external hard drive (so I can transport this VM to any computer with VMWare 12 on it).
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                    Mint 18.0 doesn't require a lot of space, but I'm going to choose to increase the default of 20GB up to 50GB - it is highly unlikely I'll ever get to 50GB and the space won't be used unless its needed.  So 50GB is the MAXIMUM that this VM will ever be (at least hard drive space), not including snapshots.  Also, putting it into one file makes it a little faster - splitting into multiple files is only necessary if you're planning to store this VM somehwere with a FAT32 file system (unlikely!).
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>
                                    The VM is basically done at this point.  However, we're going to "Customize Hardware", so click there:
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/createVM.png">
                                    <figcaption>Almost Done - Click "Customize Hardware"</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    First, we're going to increase the RAM of this VM, which will make it run faster.  For me, 4GB of RAM represents one quarter of the total RAM in my host machine, so it's not a stretch.  You'll have to use your own judgement here, based on what your computer can handle.  However, going past 4GB is hardly necessary.
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/increaseRAM.png">

                                <p>
                                    Also, increase the number of processors to however many processors your computer has.  This may seem counterintuitive, but VMWare actually prefers that you allocate all processors to the VM, this makes it run smoother.  The VM and the Host work out who does what when (VMWare figures that out), but if you allocate less to the VM, it just has less to work with and is therefore slower.  Again, this is dependent on your computer - allocate as many cores as you have.  Click "Close" once you're done, and then "Finish" on the final screen.
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                    Step 2 is complete!  You've created a VM to house Mint 18.0 in!

                                    After Mint starts up, you'll be confronted with a screen that looks like the Operating System is installed:
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                    However, this is simply Mint running off of the .iso file, similar to running off of a USB stick or a CD (lots of distributions of Linux can do this).  I want to intall Mint to this VM, and then it will be independent of the .iso, and it will be more similar to installing Mint on a phyisical computer.  I'll double click "Install Linux Mint" to do this.  The following window will result:

                                    After a few minutes, Mint completes its installation.  You'll need to restart in order to finalize the installation:

                                    Upon restart, Mint may ask you to "Remove the Installation Medium" - what this means is that the .iso image we used to install is showing up as a DVD in the optical drive.  This can be corrected in VMWare by clicking on VM &rarr; Settings:
                                </p>

                                    After you're logged in, you'll get a "Welcome Screen" that looks like this:

                                    After browsing anything you're interested in on the Welcome Screen, its time to shut down Mint 18.0 and take a "Snapshot" in VMWare, which you can roll back to at any point in the future, thereby ensuring you don't have to do this process again (unless you want to!).   Shut down by clicking the lower left corner and selecting the power button, which when hovered over brings up a menu which says "Quit":
                                </p>

                                    Step 3 is complete!  You've installed Mint 18.0 on a VM!

                                <p>
                                    You're now ready to start installing some updates for Mint 18.0.  Begin by powering up the VM and logging in.  When ready, it'll look like this:
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/mintStartupInstalled.png">

                                <p>
                                    Now its time to install the updates.  Open a "Terminal" window by typing <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + T</kbd> or by clicking the Terminal icon in the lower left corner.  We'll get our updates by typing <kbd>sudo apt-get update</kbd> and then entering our password (in BASH - aka Terminal - when you type a password it doesn't show up, just type the password and press ENTER!):
                                </p>

                                    To run all the upgrades, type <kbd>sudo apt-get upgrade</kbd>:
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>
                                    Mint will ask if you are sure you want to do the upgrades, simply type <kbd>Y + ENTER</kbd> to continue (this will take a few minutes):
                                </p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>
                                    Once the update/upgrade process completes you'll need to reboot the system to make sure that everything is up and running.  This can be done with <kbd>sudo reboot</kbd>:
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/reboot.png">

                                <p>
                                    At this point it makes a ton of sense to do another snapshot (see above if you're confused as to how).  A good snapshot name might be "updatesInstalled"
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <h4><strong>Step 5: Install Open-VM-Tools</strong></h4>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Its a good idea to install "OpenVMTools" on your VM, that way its a little easier to do things like "drag-and-drop" files, etc.  This isn't strictly mandatory, its just a comfort feature.  Start by opening a "Terminal" (<kbd>Ctrl + Alt + T</kbd>) and type <kbd>sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools</kbd>.  Once again, Mint will ask for the super user password and will ask you to confirm you'd like to install the packages you selected:
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/openVMTools.png">
                                    <figcaption><kbd>sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools</kbd></figcaption>

                                <p>
                                    We'll also be installing the desktop version of the OpenVMTools, using <kbd>sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop</kbd>:
                                </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img class="img-responsive centered" src="<?= $siteRoot; ?>images/sysAdmin/linux/mint18Install/openVMToolsDesktop.png">
                                    <figcaption><kbd>sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop</kbd></figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    After this completes, the installation is virtually done.  Be sure to mess around a little in Mint to make sure that the internet works, that the VM can go full screen, etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The final thing to do to complete this VM installation is to shut down the VM and take a final snapshot.  The directions on how to do this are above, but again choose a sensible name such as "openVMToolsInstalled".
