                          This information is based in large part on the PMBOK&reg; Guide, 5th ed.  The second chapter of this guide is "Organizational Influences and Project Life Cycle" and the following is a brief synopsis of that chapter.

                      <p>
                        Project Management is one of the most important aspects of business.  However, it happens within a business, it is not the entire business.  Even firms that specialize in Project Management have other aspects to their business such as their business structure, style and culture.  These can have a drastic influence on a project; it is critical that successful project managers understand how organizations influence projects.
                      </p>
                      <h3>How Does An Organization Influence a Project?</h3>
                      <p>
                        First and foremost an organization has a culture built into it.  This means that things are done in a certain way within any organization; perfectly accepted behaviour in one company could be unacceptable in another.  For example, in one company, all decisions, even minor changes, may be referred to a member of the executive (CEO, CIO, CTO, CFO, etc), while in other companies is is expected that teams of staff make decisions based on their experience and opinions.  These types of varying expectations have a major impact on how much control a project manager has over any given project.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Effective organizational communication also has a major impact on project management.  If communication amongst all stakeholders is easy and clear, the project is much more likely to succeed.

                      <h3>Organizational Structures and Project Management</h3>
                      <p>
                        All businesses have an organzational structure.  From a project management perspective, these can be divided into six major categories:
                        <ol class="textList">
                          <li><strong>Functional</strong> - projects are coordinated by functional managers, not by staff.</li>
                          <li><strong>Weak Matrix</strong> - projects are coordinated by the staff involved in the project.</li>
                          <li><strong>Balanced Matrix</strong> - a specialized project manager works with staff to coordinate (and perform) a project.</li>
                          <li><strong>Strong Matrix</strong> - a project manager from the project management division works with staff to coordinate a project.</li>
                          <li><strong>Projectized</strong> - the organizaiton is divided into project management groups, where the project manager is the head of their own departement, which only works on projects.</li>
                          <li><strong>Composite</strong> - major projects are handled by a dedicated project management department, while minor projects are handled by general staff.  Most organizations are composite.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>
