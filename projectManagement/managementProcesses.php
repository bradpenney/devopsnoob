                          This information is based in large part on the PMBOK&reg; Guide, 5th ed.  The third chapter of this guide is "Project Management Processes" and the following is a brief synopsis of that chapter.

                      <h3>Project Management Processes vs. Product-Oriented Processes</h3>
                      <p>
                        To clarify, this discussion is based on generic project managment processes - the methods of project management and the role of the project manager within these methods.  This discussion doesn't touch on the technical side of creating a product - clearly that sort of discussion is beyond the scope of any one website.  Please apply the methods and techniques being discussed here to the any business project, but realize anything related to a specific product will need its own set of requirements, processes and techniques.

                      <h3>5 Project Management Process Groups</h3>
                      <p>
                        Project management is sub-divided into 5 different processes.  Its really important to remember, however, that these processes are somewhat of an artificial distinction imposed "from above" by project managers (and project management theorists!).  For example, there is no separate "Monitoring and Controlling" stage - its built into the entire project.  Not one deliverable will be produced, not one business requirment will be agreed upon, without monitoring and controlling.  It is separate enough to be considered its own process, but its built into every aspect of the entire project.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Here are the five project managment process groups:

                      </figure>
                      <p>
                        Notice that these 5 processes are not represented in a linear fashion, but rather in a context-diagram fashion.  While the general goal is to start with initiating and move towards closing, its important to remember that project management is an iterative process - planning, executing, monitoring/controlling will all happen continuously, there is no specific order.  As the project progresses, planning will decrease and execution will increase.  However, its almost never too late to revist the planning stage, whether to clarify or to modify.  <strong>Project Managment is an iterative process!!</strong>
